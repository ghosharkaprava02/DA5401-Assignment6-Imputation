## Documentation

This repository contains my submission for **Assignment 6** of DA5401.  
The focus is on handling **missing data** in the UCI Credit Card Default Clients Dataset using **imputation via regression** methods.

The notebook covers:  
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Introducing MAR missingness in features.  
2. **Simple Imputation:** Filling missing values with median (baseline).  
3. **Regression Imputation (Linear & Non-Linear):** Using Linear Regression and KNN Regressor to impute missing values.  
4. **Data Splitting & Standardization:** Preparing datasets for modeling.  
5. **Classification:** Training Logistic Regression on imputed and deleted datasets.  
6. **Performance Evaluation:** Comparing model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

This assignment illustrates how different imputation methods affect model performance and underscores the importance of missing data management.
